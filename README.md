This is my take on V1 Engineerings' MP3DP "Repet". At its core, this is a 400mm Cubed print volume using 3 lengths of extrusion that can be easily sourced and even pre-tapped by TNUTZ or cut and tapped yourself if you have the tools.

My main contributions are around the Z Gantry. the Base plate and heated bed are the only real hard parts to get a hold of, but I sourced some Aluminum cutoffs of proper length from EBay for the same price as just a heated bed plate for Voron V2.4 w/ 50mm extra on each axis (more if you factor in the ever shortening Z axis). All the other parts should be common sourced wherever you get your usual 3D Printer parts (Amazon, AliExpress, West3D, etc....)

I have a Voron V2.4 and I love it, but it was complicated. I needed another large format printer at preferably a lower price.

I'm also working on making this printer fully enclosed, as I'll need the larger parts in ABS, therefore the printed parts I'm using are also ABS.

My other main contribution is the basement section. I liked the DIN Rails the Voron used, but I didn't like having to flip/rotate that beast around. so my Basement/EEBAY will be accessable by removing the panel at the bottom of the printer off to have full access to everything.

# MP3DP-Repeat
This is the MP3DP -Repeat- __Milled/Printed 3D Printer "Repeat"__.  This can be a fun project  to use your new CNC mill for. This is my take on a CoreXY 3D printer, with a CNC mill friendly frame, or even an 20 series extrusion frame, options! 

The Repeat is a whole new take from the previous two designs and I wanted to get a little 
experimental this time around in a few ways.  
* CoreXY instead of a "bed slinger". After two fun [ZenXY](../zenxy/index.md) designs using 
CoreXY I think I have wrapped my head around the strengths and weaknesses of this geometry. 
* More frame options, instead of just material and thickness, you can not opt to use 80 series 
extrusions instead of milled flat parts.
* Direct Belt Driven Z axis. The resolution is there, quiet, fewer unique parts.
* Hardware bed leveling (true bed leveling), and software (mesh leveling). Takes a bit longer to 
get started but flawless first layers are worth it. Time to make more accurate parts.
* Simple Universal tool plate. Mount any extruder, laser, dragknife, pen, etc... 
* Carbon fiber and linear rails. Quiet, accurate, and light where it is needed. The larger the build
 the more noticeable the weight loss.

* Very few unique printed parts, so editing is simple. 11(?), at last count.
